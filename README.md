# Capstone-Self-Assessment

## Roles
### 1. Feature Engineering
Through the project I took the responsibility of feature engineering the dataset to prepare the data for the machine learning model. within this role I did research on how we would
deal with the various types of data in the dataset and prepare that data so it could be used in the machine learning model.
### 2. Project Management
I also took on the task of project management by bringing the team together in discussion to go through the required deliverables for each segment
and ensuring each team member collaboratively reviewed each deliverable for approval and they were ready for submission.

## Contributions
My counterparts in my team took on other important roles such as data exploration, machine learning model development, documentation and dashboard creation.
Although I was not directly involved in the initial creation of each of these, I contributed by doing some research on any challenges the team was facing 
and sharing findings with the team through our slack channel with the hope to provide them with additional sources to learn about the challenge to find a
solution.

## Personal Challenges
My biggest personal challenge throughout the project was the natural language processing used in the feature engineering section, this took a lot of research and
team/peer discussions and many code alterations to determine what functions within natural language processing library would best meet the needs of the
machine learning model. Through my research I was able to extend my knowledge on how to work with different types of data allowing me to overcome this challenge.

## Team Assessment
### Teamwork
Most of the communication with my team was done through slack and class zoom calls.
The team was able to communicate efficiently throughout the project with one of the main challenges with scheduling time outside of class time for everyone
to review work and approve for submission. In future I would like to have worked with the team to commit to meeting times on submission days in order to
approve the work more collaboratively.

### Team Strengths
My counterparts on the team have a vast knowledge across different industries and have existing experience working with data.
I believe the team have good communication skills and were able to comfortably communicate and raise any issues they were having with the rest of the team and were able to comfortably
communicate any challenges they were facing.

For new comers starting projects team communication is very important throughout the project and ensuring the team members are comfortable enough to challenge
each others thoughts.

## Summary of Project
### Topic
We set out to create a machine learning that could be implemented in job posting boards in order to predict if a job posting is fraudulent in order to reduce identity
theft by fraudsters and scammers that are using fake job posting in phishing techniques to gain access to personal information.
### Machine learning model used
LightGBM was used as the final machine learning model as we found it provided the best accuracy to performance for this project.
### Results
In the end we were able to achieve a 98% accuracy from the model which worked well considering our sample dataset was skewed with only 5% of the data points identified as fraudulent.
We determined that if our machine learning model is implemented in the job posting workflow the model could predict fraudulent job posting and prevent them from going live on the
public job board reducing identity theft.
