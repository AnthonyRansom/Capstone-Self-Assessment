# Capstone-Self-Assessment

##Self Assessment
###Roles
####Feature Engineering
Through the project i took the responsibility of feature engineering the dataset to prepare the data for the machine learning model 
####Project Management
I also took on the task of project management by bringing the team together in discussion to go through the required delvierables for each segment
and ensuring each team member collaboratively review each delieverable to approve they were ready for submission

###Contributions
The other team members took on other impratant roles such as data exploration, machine learning model development and document and dashboard creation
although I was not directly involved in the inital creation of each of these i contributed by doing some research on my own and sharing findings with the 
team through our slack channel

###challenges
My biggest personal challenge throughout the project was the natural language processing used in the feature engineering section, this took a lot of research and
team/peer discussions a long with many code alterations to determine what functions within natural language processing library would best meet the needs of the
machine learning model

##Team Assessment
###Teamwork
Most of the communication with my team was done thorugh slack and class zoom calls
Their communication protocol, including any 
challenges, how they were resolved, and what they 
would do differently next time

###Team Strengths
 Their strengths as a team, including tips and tricks 
they would want to share with a new cohort kicking off 
the project
